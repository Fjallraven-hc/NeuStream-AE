The experments consist of three main parts: Diffusion, LLM, and Multi-Agent.  
Because of the GitHub single file size limitation, user has to manually run the script `merge_large_file_fragment.sh` to get the origin model parameters.  
For convenience, we didn't upload unnecessary model parameters, so part of the models are serving with randomly initialized parameters, but this has no effect on the serving performance.

The artifacts will be also provided through Baidu Netdisk, where some model parameters are also stored. The uncompressed file size is about 20GB.  
For Diffusion and LLM part, please access the artifacts through https://pan.baidu.com/s/19pzsF1IBwu7QkJ42j2R4ng?pwd=qq45 code:qq45  
For MultiAgent part, please access the artifacts through https://pan.baidu.com/s/1PyaLMXABYd0jcFV8raaYaA?pwd=mmpc code:mmpc  
Alternatively, artifacts can be accessed through OneDrive link: https://1drv.ms/u/c/e3200eaf81ba2fa8/EfDf2yp2UEZMi9gdaVQ-1TMBn37em9XQRs9HwmL524s-JA?e=bxCcNC
